## Data analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to determine success of plays

The data show that theater campaigns are the most common Kickstarter category. Moreover, theater campaigns have the most successful and the most unsuccessful outcomes.

Therefore, it is important to look at why some of these campaigns were successful and others were not. Importantly, the data show that the month of when the campaign was launched can predict the success of the project funding.

As we can see, starting the campaign in May has the best success rate. Furthermore, the later in the year that the campaign was launched, the less successful it was. In fact, when these campaigns were launched in December, more campaigns failed rather than succeeded.
